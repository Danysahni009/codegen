        <p>Developers with solid skills in the .Net technologies have been in demand for many years. Microsoft released its first version of Visual Studio.NET in 2002, creating a near-instant demand for developers with skills in the .Net framework. In the years since, more developers have acquired these skills, but a shortage remains. In the United States, there are approximately six open positions for every job seeker with .Net qualifications, and salaries are about 8 percent higher than similar development jobs.
