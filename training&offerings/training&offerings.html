<h3>Implementation of VLAN In a Network Project</h3>
<p> Code: IT/05</p>
 <p>In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a domain is referred to as a Virtual Local Area Network, Virtual LAN or VLAN. A VLAN has the same attributes as a physical local area network (LAN), but it allows for end stations to be grouped together more easily even if they are not on the same network switch. Most enterprise-level networks today use the concept of virtual LANs. Without VLANs, a switch considers all interfaces on the switch to be in the same broadcast domain. This project will enable candidates to Implement VLAN of a Institution / campus and enable them to understand the various concepts of VLAN.</p>

<h3>Implementation of DHCP / DNS In a Network</h3>
 <p>Project Code: IT/07</p>
 <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to configure devices that are connected to a network so they can communicate on that network using the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol is implemented in a client-server model, in which DHCP clients request configuration data, such as an IP address, a default route, and one or more DNS server addresses from a DHCP server. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating computer services and devices worldwide. By providing a worldwide, distributed keyword-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet. This project will enable candidates to implement DHCP and DNS in a Network and enable them to understand the concepts behind them.</p>
